// resizable application window
// Able to filter the bosses between certain areas in the map (leyndale, caelid, shadow erdtree, etc...)
// Saves locally automatically when checking off a boss, saved locally when exiting the form app, reloads when opening the form app

// remember to refactor
// remember to make the UI look better

bugs:
-searching a hidden checked off boss shows back up again
- clicking hide all checked off bosses, and then checking a boss doesnt work until you unselect and reselect the option
- clicking a boss box, and then checking hide all checked bosses, and then clicking reset all checked bosses doesnt show back the boss that was checked and then unchecked
